Companies across various industries, including technology, finance, healthcare, and retail, are increasingly leveraging data to make informed decisions. As a result, Data Professionals, who can turn raw data into actionable insights, have become one of the most in-demand professionals globally.\n\nWithin this expansive field, a myriad of titles and positions exist, reflecting a spectrum of responsibilities. Examples include Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and Machine Learning Scientists. While this project does not intend to clarify the precise definitions of these roles, it aims to provide a comprehensive snapshot of the current Data Science job market, as seen through the job postings on Glassdoor. \n\nAdditionally, I hope that the findings of this project will not only assist me but also aid other job seekers in uncovering valuable insights for navigating the data science job market. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='Primary-Objective'></a>\n### **Primary Objective:** ##\nThis project analyzes a dataset of Data Science job postings from Glassdoor to uncover key insights into the job market.

Data Cleaning:\n* Refine the 'Job Title' column, consolidating redundant entries into 8 standard, commonly used titles.\n* Split the 'Salary Estimate' column into 'Salary Lower Bound', 'Salary Upper Bound', and 'Salary Midpoint'.\n* Transform the 'Location' column into separate 'Country', 'State', and 'City' columns, standardizing states with their abbreviations.\n* Perform essential cleaning procedures on other columns, tailored to their respective values and data types.\n\n#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n* Show the distribution of key variables, such as job titles, company sizes, and business sectors.\n* Visualize the geographical distribution of job postings across the United States and their average salary midpoints.\n* Utilize various graphs to explore the relationships between average salary midpoints and other company characteristics.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='data-preparation'></a>\n## **Data Preparation and Cleaning:**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='importation'></a>\n### Importation:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport fuzzywuzzy\nfrom fuzzywuzzy import process\nimport re\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n\n# some display settings:\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 100)\n\n\n# load the data\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/data-science-job-posting-on-glassdoor/Uncleaned_DS_jobs.csv\", index_col='index')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.837963Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.838400Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.900039Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.838362Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.898963Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='data-overview'></a>\n### Understand the data:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head(10)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.902436Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.902918Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.931560Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.902876Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.930339Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.933259Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.933657Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.946045Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.933625Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.944935Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.dtypes","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.948314Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.948678Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.962407Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.948649Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.961530Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.describe(include = 'all')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.965748Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.966332Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-02T22:58:14.030376Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-02T22:58:13.966302Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-02T22:58:14.029276Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# check data index uniqueness\ndata.index.duplicated(keep = 'first').sum()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-02T22:58:14.031696Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-02T22:58:14.032165Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-02T22:58:14.040624Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-02T22:58:14.032126Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-02T22:58:14.039479Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# check the number of missing values in each column\ndata.isna().sum(axis = 0)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-02T22:58:14.042299Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-02T22:58:14.042785Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-02T22:58:14.061943Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-02T22:58:14.042746Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-02T22:58:14.060500Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have checked that the data has a non-duplicate index list, and there are no missing values in the data set.

As for the senior positions, we were unable to find clear evidence to support our hypothesis that senior titles, on average, command higher salaries.\n\n2. The choropleth maps in our analysis reveal the significant geographical variations in the data science job market across the United States, with coastal states generally offering more opportunities and higher salaries compared to central states. California stands as a significant hotspot, boasting a high number of job postings, although its average salary midpoints are not exceptionally high when compared to certain other states.

The Information and Technology sector stands out as a leader in job opportunities, indicating a robust demand for data professionals in technology-centric industries.

Analysis Implications\nThe insights from this analysis can serve as a valuable guide for data science job seekers as they craft their career strategies. \n\n* Firstly, while the Information and Technology sector is a hotbed for data science opportunities, it is advisable for professionals to explore alternative sectors as well. Some sectors, such as Government and Aerospace & Defense, may have fewer positions available, but they tend to offer higher compensation. This scenario underscores the importance of cultivating specialized skills that align with the unique demands of these sectors.\n\n* Secondly, location matters; coastal states like California and New York not only offer a high number of job opportunities but also competitive salaries. However, individuals must weigh these prospects against the cost of living in these regions. \n\n* Lastly, the data does not support the common assumption that larger companies invariably offer higher salaries. As such, job seekers should cast a wider net, considering positions in smaller or medium-sized companies, which might offer competitive salaries, potentially lower stress levels, and a more intimate work environment.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n#### 2. Limitations:\nWhile these insights offer valuable guidance for data science job seekers, it is important to recognize that this analysis has its limitations. The following are some of the limitations of this study that should be considered when interpreting its findings:\n* Outdated Data: The dataset was recorded in 2021, and as the analysis is being conducted in 2023, there might have been significant changes in the data science job market. The two-year gap could have resulted in shifts in salary ranges, job demand in various locations, and industry hiring trends. This time lag may affect the current relevance and applicability of the findings.\n\n* Limited Sample Size: The dataset contains only 672 job postings, which may not be sufficiently large to accurately represent the entire data science job market. For example, there is only one data entry for Delaware, and only 3 job postings for the Education sector. This limited sample size could potentially skew the analysis and may not capture the full scope of the job market.\n\n* Source Bias and Data Integrity: The data was web scraped from Glassdoor. Relying on a single source for data can introduce bias, as Glassdoor’s listings may not be fully representative of the broader job market. Meanwhile, because we could not validate the integrity of the scraped data, this raises questions about the accuracy and completeness of the information used in this analysis.\n\n* Salary Estimates: The dataset does not provide fixed salary values, but rather a wide range estimated by Glassdoor. Additionally, the analysis is based on salary midpoints, which are calculated as the middle value between the given upper and lower limits. Since the actual distribution of salaries within this range is unclear, this approach may not accurately reflect the actual salary offers. This could, in turn, affect the reliability of the salary insights generated by the analysis.\n\n* Title Consolidation: In the analysis, we consolidated the job titles into 8 general categories. However, the responsibilities of a data science professional can vary significantly based on their main field. This title aggregation process may introduce potential bias.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='acknowledgement'></a>\n## **Acknowledgement**\n1.
